# SharePoint Kanban (2010 - 2013)

##An Agile Kanban "signboard" application for SharePoint 2010-2013 built on Angular JS.

By adding this Angular application to any of your SharePoint sites, you can turn any SharePoint list, of content type Projects or Tasks, into your own Agile Kanban dashboard. 

“Kanban” is a Japanese term for a signboard or billboard and was first developed by Taiichi Ohno at the Toyota Corporation and used to manage production schedules. To learn more about Kanban boards, their history and uses, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban and http://kanbanblog.com/explained/.

A Kanban configuration usually includes at least several columns and can be as simple as sticky notes on a whiteboard or as sophisticated as drag-and-drop software applications that all members of your team interact with. Each column represents the status of the projects within the column. Column names vary but traditionally they include: Backlog, In Progress, Testing, Done/Complete. When the status of a project changes, one simply moved the notecard to the next column. 

If you’ve been using Task or Projects lists in SharePoint for any amount of time, you know there are task statuses in the Status field of each list item: Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Waiting on someone else, and Deferred. We can transform this list and its existing list items into the Kanban format. By doing so, you can transform your basic and unintuitive stock list view into a powerful visual and interactive tool, that will increase the productivity of your team members.
